Who has not dreamed of creating something in 3D, or even better: 3D running in a browser?! We also had this dream, and during a hackathon in early 2018 we finally fulfilled it by using BabylonJS. We started to build an interactive control panel for managing all IoT devices in our office building. Having had no prior experience whatsoever, we got to know the framework by working with it and having to fix our own mistakes.<br/> 
In this talk we, will share our experiences using BabylonJS and show you how to get started with building 3D web applications. We will cover all the basics needed to implement a small 3D web app with BabylonJS.
